# TaskTracker CLI

TaskTracker CLI is a Python-based command-line application designed to manage tasks efficiently. It allows users to add,
list, update, and delete tasks, with all tasks stored in a JSON file for persistence. 


## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Create tasks with a `unique ID`, `description`, and `timestamp`.
- **List Tasks**: View all tasks or filter them by status (e.g., `todo`, `in-progress`, `done`).
- **Update Tasks**: Modify task descriptions or mark their statuses.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks by their unique ID.
- **Persistent Storage**: Task data is stored in a JSON file (`tasks.json`) and loaded automatically.
- **Error Handling**: Provides user-friendly error messages and validations for all operations.
