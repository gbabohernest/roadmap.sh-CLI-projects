# Number Guessing Game

This is a **CLI-based application** developed as part of the [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/projects/number-guessing-game) backend skills development project

In this game:

- The computer randomly selects a number within a predefined range.
- The user attempts to guess the number.
- The game is won if the user successfully guesses the number within the allowed attempts.


This project helps engineers build their skills in Python by implementing logical workflows and input handling.
